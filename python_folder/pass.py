#pass: The pass statement in Python is used as a placeholder. 
# It's a way to write syntactically correct code when you haven't
#  written the actual logic yet, or when no action is required
# 1. Empty function, class, or loop — to avoid syntax errors
#You can't leave blocks empty in Python — doing so will raise an error. 
#Use pass to skip writing actual code for now.

def my_function():
    pass  # Placeholder for future code

class MyClass:
    pass  # Class will be defined later

for i in range(5):
    pass  # Loop does nothing for now
